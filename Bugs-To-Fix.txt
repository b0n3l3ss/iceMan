0 THERE IS A BUG THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP!!!! if you grab the oil or gold before the sonar
  is removed from the vector, then it crashes. I implemented a loop in the move function that 
  will update the vector position of the remaining actors if one of the previous actors was deleted.
  This loop will only run if it runs into an actor in "dead" state, so we need to go back and fix
  the gold and oil barrels so that instead of deleteting them when we run into them, we set them dead.
