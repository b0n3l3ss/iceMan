## IceMan

Ice Man is a arcade videogame where each level, Iceman has to collect all of the oil barrels, hidden in the ice, to 
procede to the next level.  He has to avoid protestors on his search, but can temporarily stun them by either dropping
a boulder on them, or squirting them with water.  The programm was developed by myself and [Greg Clark](https://github.com/Greg-Clark).
We implemented all the classes for all of the game entities, including characters, power-ups, map-entities and scoreboard using object 
oriented programming and inheritance.
